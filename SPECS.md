## Code Quality Specs [To be included in new projects and edited on Monday morning]

- [ ] User-Friendly - Pages load fast, UX design principles followed, styled enough to not offend the eye|
- [ ] Tested - All specs passing; at least [70%] test coverage as reported by CodeClimate
- [ ] Documented - In files like CONTRIBUTING.md, so that other devs can quickly start coding
- [ ] Functional - Project runs in localhost and, if required, in production [on Heroku]
- [ ] Structured - Directory structure allows new developers to quickly find and add files
- [ ] Clearly Named - Functions, variables, files, CSS classes and ids
- [ ] Abstracted - Small, single-responsibility functions leveraged for encapsulation & reusability
- [ ] Git Logged - Readable and clean with clear, complete, professional commit messages
- [ ] Linted - Gets no unexpected errors from [StandardJS, eslint] linter
- [ ] Reviewed - Passes [3.0 GPA] CodeClimate or peer code review
- [ ] Not Commented - Unless truly necessary. No dead code, console.logs, fits/xits
- [ ] Fast - Delivers optimal O(n) complexity
